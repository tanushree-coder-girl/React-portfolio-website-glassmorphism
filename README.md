## About This Project

I created this project as a learning experiment to dive deep into React, explore modern UI trends like Glassmorphism, and integrate interactive features like theme switching. This project allowed me to practice working with React components, CSS effects, and popular libraries such as React Router, Swiper, and Particles.js.
